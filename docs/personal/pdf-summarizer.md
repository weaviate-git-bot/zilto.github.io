title: PDF Summarizer
---
Here's an extensible and production-ready PDF summarizer that you can run anywhere! The frontend uses streamlit, which communicates with a FastAPI backend powered by Hamilton. You give it a PDF file via the browser app and it returns you a text summary using the OpenAI API. If you want, you skip the browser inteface and directly access the /summarize endpoint with your document! Everything is containerized using Docker, so you should be able to run it where you please üèÉ.

The ingestion and retrieval steps are implemented as dataflows with Hamilton and are exposed via FastAPI endpoints. The frontend is built with Streamlit and exposes the different functionalities via a simple web UI. Everything is packaged as containers with docker compose.
