          <p> In 2019, I decided I would either learn the German or the Python language. I ended up going through the book <a class="italic" href="https://learncodethehardway.com/client/#/product/learn-python-the-hard-way-5e-2023/" target="_">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> while commuting between my full-time work, evening university classes, and home. Soon after, I learned about machine learning in the context of neurosciences and enrolled for a Master's in Computational Medicine. This website is an effort to document and share my programming journey.</p>

          <p>If there's an activity you've been interested in and putting away, I encourage you to stop reading this and go focus on that instead! You'll be amazed by the progress you've made in a week, a month, and a year from now. Practice makes perfect and more is more.</p>
